This is a website that explains all of the captures in the video game Super Mario Odyssey, including information about how they work in-game, where they can be found, and a little fun fact. The captures will be shown on cards with accordions so the information will be hidden until you click on it. There will also be a trivia quiz included for anyone wanting to test their skills. 

This project will include the following features:

Create a responsive menu with CSS
Run PageSpeed Insights from google.com get a score of 60 or better
Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover.
Create accordion boxes to display different types of information.
Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page
